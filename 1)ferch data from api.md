1)ferch data from api
2)render data on the ui
3)create pagenation
4)convert that pagenation to the elipse pagenation
5)sort for the page for the pagenation nedd to work
6)filter the data for that page nation nedd to work
------------------------------------------------------------------
if i create the above one what thing i learn

1)how to use use multible varibles to hold different data
2)ye varibale yela like chaiyali (why we are linking that varibale)
3)event lisiner (how we are calling function)
4)yee code globale scoper lo rayali (default ga load avali )
5)(which code we write on the function scope)-->(ye code function scope lo raylai)-->fo the varible validati is pre with in the local socpe
6)debug the code in the fast way
7)where we nedd to keep loaders
8)when i nedd to use chat gpt
----------

note: allwa we are printing data on the ui screen with the jelp of varible calling(all the data is print on the ui is by uising array data only)
--------------------
learn array method also which method we need to use when we nedd to use
paratice is key to sucess

advantage of practice 1_how fast we will comple wrok
                      2)why we are writng the in this patern only
					  3)we can under the way with 100% knowledge ,learning 100% is bgeter that half of knowledge
					  4)
					  
------------------------
data is key to every project (baded on the data structeu and functionlaity will chnage)



---------------by using reactjs
1)component
2)states
3)hooks
4)events
5)routes
6)lifecycle
7)conditional rendering
